# Connexus Restyled

Partially fixes Connexus's asinine purple kindergartener-focused redesign through a userscript and stylesheet.

Not perfect, but quite a lot better than the hideous shade of purple they chose.  Tweaks a few other colors too to be closer to the old design.

## Installation

Install Tampermonkey and Stylus.  Go to [connexus.com](https://www.connexus.com).  On Tampermonkey click "Create a new script" and paste in the contents of `connexus-restyled.js`.  On Stylus check the box marked "write style for", then click the domain, then paste the contents of `connexus-restyled.css`.
